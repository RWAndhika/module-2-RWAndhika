# Nuqi's Web Portofolio

![Nuqi's Portofolio banner](./img/banner.png)

This is a web portofolio of my friend Nuqi (Ibnu Hafiz Fadhilah) as to help me practice my front-end skill. Artworks and graphics presented are property of his and belong to their respective owner. Here I will try to keep the theme as similar as possible from the original portofolio.
